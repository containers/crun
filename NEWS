  processes that cannot be terminated.
- support additional options for idmap mounts.  It is now possible to
  specify what mappings must be used for the idmapped mount.

  source directory are not required to be accessible to the users in
  the user namespace.

* crun-1.4.2

  before re-mounting /dev as read-only.

- Fix check for an invalid path.  crun was performing the wrong check
  to validate a path, causing spurious failures at runtime.

  against what the OCI runtime specs dictate, but it is the expected
  behavior since runc allows it.
- Fix regression when joining a container that has explicit paths for
  the namespaces.

  `/dev/` was not properly detected as mounting /dev/ from the host.

  using cgroup v2.
- retry the openat2 syscall if it fails with EAGAIN.

- exec: fix regression in 1.1 where containers are being wrongly
  reported as paused.
- criu: add support for external ipc, uts and time namespaces.

  container through its cgroup as there is no need to recurse over the
  cgroup pids and terminate each one of them.
- exec: refuse to exec in a paused container/cgroup.
- container: Set primary process to 1 via LISTEN_PID by default if
  user configuration is missing.
- criu: Add support for external PID namespace.
- criu: fix save of external descriptors.  Now restored containers
  attach correctly their standard streams.
