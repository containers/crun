* crun-1.19.1

- linux: fix a hang if there are no reads from the tty.  Use non
  blocking sockets to read and write from the tty so that the "crun
  exec" process doesn't hang when the terminal is not consuming any
  data.
- linux: remove the workaround needed to mount a cgroup on top of
  another cgroup mount.  The workaround had the disadvantage to
  temporarily leak a mount on the host.  The alternative that is
  currently used is to mount a temporary tmpfs between the two cgroup
  mounts.

* crun-1.19

- wasm: add new handler wamr.
- criu: allow passing network lock method to libcriu.
- linux: honor exec cpu affinity mask.
- build: fix build with musl libc.
- crun: use mount API to self-clone.
- cgroup, systemd: do not override devices on update.  If the "update" request has no
  device block configured, do not reset the previously configuration.
- cgroup: handle case where cgroup v1 freezer is disabled.  On systems without the
  freezer controller, containers were mistakenly reported as paused.
- cgroup: do not stop process on exec.  The cpu mask is configured on the systemd
  scope, the previous workaround to stop the container until the cgroup is fully
  configured is no longer needed.

* crun-1.18.2

- cgroup, systemd: fix a regression when a configuration file includes only one
  default rule.

* crun-1.18.1

- cgroup: deprecate cgroup v1.
- cgroup: fix regression setting up the devices cgroup on cgroup v1.
- cgroup: fix regression and work again with the default Docker devices
  configuration on systemd.
- linux: fix setting up user namespace when newuidmap/newgidmap are not available.

* crun-1.18

- cgroup: support running without a sub-cgroup with systemd.  Use the
  d-bus API to set the container limits on the systemd scope itself.
  It allows running without a sub-cgroup when the systemd driver is
  used, the run.oci.systemd.subgroup annotation controls it.  For now,
  a sub-cgroup is still created, but it might be changed in future.
- cgroup: add support for the misc controller.
- linux: fix running on kernel without user namespaces.
- criu, restore: add lsm-profile option.
- criu, restore: add lsm-mount-context option.
- linux: add duplicate namespace detection.

* crun-1.17

- Add `--log-level` option.  It accepts `error`, `warning` and `error`.
- Add debug logs for container creation.
- Fix double-free in crun exec code that could lead to a crash.
- Allow passing an ID to the journald log driver.
- Report "executable not found" errors after tty has been setup.
- Do not treat EPIPE from hooks as an error.
- Make sure `DefaultDependencies` is correctly set in the systemd scope.
- Improve the error message when the container process is not found.
- Improve error handling for the mnt namespace restoration.
- Fix error handling for `getpwuid_r`, `recvfrom` and `libcrun_kill_linux`.
- Fix handling of device paths with trailing slashes.

* crun-1.16.1

- fix a regression introduced by 1.16 where using 'rshared' rootfs
  mount propagation and the rootfs itself is a mountpoint.
- inherit user from original process on exec, if not overridden.

* crun-1.16

- build: fix build for s390x.
- linux: fix mount of special files with rro.  Open the mount target
  with O_PATH to prevent open(2) failures with special files like
  FIFOs or UNIX sockets.
- Fix sd-bus error handling for cpu quota and period props update.
- container: use relative path for rootfs if possible.  If the rootfs
  cannot be resolved and it is below the current working directory,
  only use its relative path.
- wasmedge: access container environment variables for the WasmEdge
  configuration.
- cgroup, systemd: use MemoryMax instead of MemoryLimit.  Fixes a
  warning for using an old configuration name.
- cgroup, systemd: improve checks for sd_bus_message_append errors

* crun-1.15

- fix a mount point leak under /run/crun, add a retry mechanism to
  unmount the directory if the removal failed with EBUSY.
- linux: cgroups: fix potential mount leak when /sys/fs/cgroup is
  already mounted, causing the posthooks to not run.
- release: build s390x binaries using musl libc.
- features: add support for potentiallyUnsafeConfigAnnotations.
- handlers: add option to load wasi-nn plugin for wasmedge.
- linux: fix "harden chdir()" security measure.  The previous check
  was not correct.
- crun: add option --keep to the run command.  When specified the
  container is not automatically deleted when it exits.

* crun-1.14.4

- linux: fix mount of file with recursive flags.  Do not assume it is
  a directory, but check the source type.

* crun-1.14.3

- follow up for 1.14.2.  Drop the version check for each command.

* crun-1.14.2

- crun: drop check for OCI version.  A recent bump in the OCI runtime
  specs caused crun to fail with every config file.  Just drop the
  check since it doesn't add any value.

* crun-1.14.1

- there was recently a security vulnerability (CVE-2024-21626) in runc
  that allowed a malicious user to chdir(2) to a /proc/*/fd entry that is
  outside the container rootfs.  While crun is not affected directly,
  harden chdir by validating that we are still inside the container
  rootfs.
- container: attempt to close all the files before execv(2).
  if we leak any fd, it prevents execv to gain access to files outside
  the container rootfs through /proc/self/fd/$fd.
- fix a regression caused by 1.14 when installing the ebpf filter on a
  kernel older than 5.11.
- cgroup, systemd: fix segfault if the resources block is not specified.

* crun-1.14

- build: drop dependency on libgcrypt.  Use blake3 to compute the cache
  key.
- cpuset: don't clobber parent cgroup value when writing the cpuset
  value.
- linux: force umask(0).  Iit ensures that the `mknodat` syscall is
  not affected by the umask of the calling process, allowing file
  permissions to be set as specified in the OCI configuration.
- ebpf: do not require MEMLOCK for eBPF programs.  This requirement
  was relaxed in Linux 5.11.

* crun-1.13

- src: use O_CLOEXEC for all open/openat calls
- cgroup v1: use "max" when pids limit < 0.
- improve error message when idmap mount fails because the underlying
  file system has no support for it.
- libcrun: fix compilation when building without libseccomp and libcap.
- fix relative idmapped mount when using the custom annotation.

* crun-1.12

- add new WebAssembly handler: spin.
- systemd: fallback to system bus if session bus is not available.
- configure the cpu rt and cpuset controllers before joining them to
  avoid running temporarily the workload on the wrong cpus.
- preconfigure the cpuset with required resources instead of using the
  parent's set.  This prevents needless churn in the kernel as it
  tracks which CPUs have load balancing disabled.
- try attr/<lsm>/* before the attr/* files.  Writes to the attr/*
  files may fail if apparmor is not the first "major" LSM in the list
  of loaded LSMs (e.g. lsm=apparmor,bpf vs lsm=bpf,apparmor).

* crun-1.11.2

- fix a regression caused by 1.11.1 where the process crashes if there
  are no CPU limits configured on cgroup v1.
- fix error code check for the ptsname_r function.

* crun-1.11.1

  set all the mount flags.

* crun-1.11

- cgroup: honor cpu burst.
- systemd: set CPUQuota and CPUPeriod on the scope cgroup.
- linux: append tmpfs mode if missing for mounts.  This is the same
  behavior of runc.
- cgroup: always use the user session for rootless.

* crun-1.10

- support for Intel Resource Director Technology (RDT).
- new mount option "copy-symlink".  When provided for a mount, if the
  source is a symlink, then it is copied in the container instead of
  attempting a mount.
- linux: open mounts before setgroups if in a userns.  This solves a
  problem where a directory that was previously accessible to the
  user, become inaccessible after setgroups causing the bind mount to
  fail.

* crun-1.9.2

- cgroup: reset the inherited cpu affinity after moving to cgroup.
  Old kernels do that automatically, but new kernels remember the
  affinity that was set before the cgroup move, so we need to reset
  it in order to honor the cpuset configuration.

* crun-1.9.1

- utils: ignore ENOTSUP when chmod a symlink. It fixes a problem on
  Linux 6.6 that always refuses chmod on a symlink.
- build: fix build on CentOS 7
- linux: add new fallback when mount fails with EBUSY, so that there
  is not an additional tmpfs mount if not needed.
- utils: improve error message when a directory cannot be created as
  a component of the path is already existing as a non directory.

* crun-1.9

- linux: support arbitrary idmapped mounts.  Now it is possible to
  specify a mapping for any type of mount, not only bind mounts.
- linux: add support for "ridmap" mount option to support recursive
  idmapped mounts.
- crun delete: call systemd's reset-failed.  In case systemd cgroup
  driver is used, and the systemd unit has failed (e.g. oom-killed),
  systemd won't remove the unit (that is, unless the "CollectMode:
  inactive-or-failed" property is set).
- linux: fix check for oom_score_adj.  Write the oom_score_adj file
  even when the new value is 0.
- features: Support mountExtensions.
- linux: correctly handle unknown signal string when it doesn't start
  with a digit.
- linux: do not attempt to join again already joined namespace.
- wasmer: use latest wasix API.

  immediately after the start and the setns with the procfd failed.
- features: Fix annotations formatting.
- linux: do not write some errors twice.
- libcrun: handle SIGWINCH by resizing the terminal file descriptor.
- crun: new command "crun features".

  an existing PID namespace.
- linux: support io_priority from the OCI specs.
- linux: handle correctly the case where the status file is not
  written yet for a container.
- crun: fix segfault for "ps" when the container is not using cgroups.
- cgroup: allow setting swap to 0.

* crun-1.8.6

- crun: new command "crun features".
- linux: fix handling of idmapped mounts when the container joins
  an existing PID namespace.
- linux: support io_priority from the OCI specs.
- linux: handle correctly the case where the status file is not
  written yet for a container.
- crun: fix segfault for "ps" when the container is not using cgroups.
- cgroup: allow setting swap to 0.

* crun-1.8.5

- scheduler: use definition from the OCI configuration file instead of the custom
  label that is now dropped and not supported anymore.
- cgroup: fix creating cgroup under "domain threaded".
- cgroup, systemd: set the memory limit on the system scope.
- restore tty settings from the correct file descriptor.  It was previously
  restoring the settings from the wrong file descriptor causing the tty settings
  to be changed on the calling terminal.
- criu: check if the criu_join_ns_add function exists.  Fix a segfault with new
  versions of CRIU.
- linux: do not precreate devs with euid > 0.  Fix creating devices when running
  the OCI runtime as non root user.
- linux: improve PID detection on systems that lack pidfd.  While there is still a
  window of time that the PID could be recycled, now it is now reduced to a minimum.
- criu: fix memory leak.
- logging: improve error message when dlopen fails.

* crun-1.8.4

- fix build on CentOS 7.
- drop custom annotation to set the time namespace and use the OCI
  specs instead.
- cgroup: workaround cpu quota/period issue with v1.  Sometimes
  setting CPU quota period fails when a new period is lower, and a
  parent cgroup has CPU quota limit set.
- cgroup: fix set quota to -1 on cgroup v1.
- criu: drop loading unused functions.

* crun-1.8.3

- update: initialize the rt limits only on cgroup v1.

* crun-1.8.2

- lua bindings for libcrun.
- wasmedge: add current directory to preopen paths.
- linux: inherit parent mount flags when making a path masked.
- libcrun: custom annotation to set the scheduler for the container process.
- cgroup: fallback to blkio.bfq files if blkio is not available on cgroup v1.
- cgroup: initialize rt limits when using systemd.
- tty: chown the tty to the exec user instead of the user specified
  to create the container.
- cgroup: fallback to create cgroupfs as sibling of the current cgroup if there
  is none specified and it cannot be created in the root cgroup.

* crun-1.8.1

- linux: idmapped mounts expect the same configuration as the user
  namespace mappings.  Before they were expecting the inverted
  mapping.  It is a breaking change, but the behavior was aligned to
  what runc will do as well.
- krun: always allow /dev/kvm in the cgroup configuration.
- handlers: disable exec for handlers that do not support it.
- selinux: allow setting fscontext using a custom annotation.
- cgroup: reset systemd unit if start fails.
- cgroup: rmdir the entire systemd scope.  It fixes a leak on cgroupv1.
- cgroup: always delete the cgroup on errors. On some errors it could
  have been leaked before.

  socket.  It enables to be notified on every syscall without hanging
  the main process.

  with ENOSYS.
- krun: add support for krun-sev.
- wasmtime: always grant file system capability for workdir inside the container.

  processes that cannot be terminated.
- support additional options for idmap mounts.  It is now possible to
  specify what mappings must be used for the idmapped mount.
- open the source for a bind mount in the host.  It is useful when
  creating a user namespace so that the parent directories for the
  source directory are not required to be accessible to the users in
  the user namespace.

* crun-1.4.2

- CRIU: add pre-dump support.
- Fix running with a read-only /dev.  The /dev/console file is created
  before re-mounting /dev as read-only.
- Ignore EROFS when chowning standard stream files.
- Add validation for sysctls before applying them.
- Attempt looking up the executable after the setresuid syscall, this
  solves an issue on NFS when the executable file is not owned by root
  in the container, but the UID:GID combination configured for the
  container can access it.

* crun-1.4.1

- Fix check for an invalid path.  crun was performing the wrong check
  to validate a path, causing spurious failures at runtime.
- Allow deleting a container while in `created` state.  It goes
  against what the OCI runtime specs dictate, but it is the expected
  behavior since runc allows it.
- Fix regression when joining a container that has explicit paths for
  the namespaces.
- cgroup: do not set cpu limits if number of shares is set to 0.
  Moby uses 0 to indicate no limits.

- exec: fix regression in 1.1 where containers are being wrongly
  reported as paused.
- criu: add support for external ipc, uts and time namespaces.

* crun-1.1

- cgroup: use cgroup.kill when available. It is faster to kill a
  container through its cgroup as there is no need to recurse over the
  cgroup pids and terminate each one of them.
- exec: refuse to exec in a paused container/cgroup.
- container: Set primary process to 1 via LISTEN_PID by default if
  user configuration is missing.
- criu: Add support for external PID namespace.

  mounting a symlink.
- various small fixes to allow running regression tests outside of
  source tree.

* crun-0.14

- cgroup, systemd: create container under subcgroup.  Now a "/container"

- state: If a container is paused, report its state as 'paused'.
- cgroup: use the memory controller to ready PIDs.  The pid controller
  is not available on kernels older than 4.3.

- ebpf: fix endianness issue on s390x.
- linux: fix recursive mount on cgroup v1.

* crun-0.12.2.1

- when not using a cgroup namespace, mount only the cgroup v1 subpath.

* crun-0.12.2

- do not require read permissions on /
- add support for the "time" namespace via a custom annotation
- fix mount of cgroup v1 when using a cgroup namespace
- set default umask to 0022

* crun-0.12

- masked paths use only MS_UNBINDABLE

- safer mount options.  A temporary mount is prepared outside of the
  rootfs before being moved to it.

- handle correctly proc remounts.  It is now supported to specify hidepid=
- fix exec if a namespace is not available.
- handle swap limit with the same semantic as on cgroup v1.
- bring network device up.
- reset all signal handlers to default.

* crun-0.11

- cgroups2: map memory reservation to memory.low
- statx fallbacks to stat on EINVAL
- utils: do not fail if the path we are trying to create already
  exists
- generate seccomp profile in the parent process, not in the container
  init process.  Memory usage is more reliable now and a container can
  run with ~250K of max memory.
- support for Linux personality.
- support for umask.
- support for the hugetlb controller on cgroup v2.
- PIDs from a cgroup are read recursively.
- do not fork on "create".
- now by default seccomp doesn't fail on an unknown syscall.  The
  previous behavior can be enabled with an annotation.
- fix joining cgroup on cgroup v2 when a named hierarchy is also
  present.
- fix creating user namespaces with more than 2^32 IDs mapped.
- on exec, keep the SELinux label or AppArmor profile from the
- container configuration.
- runtime specific annotation are prefixed with run.oci.

* crun-0.10.6

- when running with a terminal, change the ownership for the terminal
  to the specified user
- spec: honor the --rootless flag
- linux: make sure the source path is resolved when checking the file
  type.  Regression introduced with 0.10.5.

* crun-0.10.5

- fix CVE-2019-18837
- fix running on CentOS/RHEL 8
- report errors opening the console socket
- not leave config.json around if the container could not be created

* crun-0.10.4

- ignore errors creating /dev/console
- add an annotation "io.crun.keep_original_groups", if it is set then
  crun won't drop additional groups when creating the container

* crun-0.10.3

- systemd: set collectmode=inactive-or-failed
- fix build on Alpine
- use the current working directory to lookup local paths
- improve the error message when a hook fails
- add granular enable/disable configure options

* crun-0.10.2

- fix a regression in 0.10.1 where cgroups v1 could not be created
- correctly chown cgroups when using a user namespace so that systemd
  can run in a container that uses a user namespace

* crun-0.10.1

- linux: Keep MS_RDONLY when remounting bind mount of a read-only
  source.  It solves an issue on Fedora Silverblue where /usr is
  mounted read only.
- fix exec of rootless containers when cgroups are not available

* crun-0.10

- support for AppArmor
- fix for CVE-2019-16884, make sure writes to /proc for the SELinux
  and AppArmor labels are on procfs.
- exec supports --preserve-fds
- seccomp: fix lookup for pseudo syscalls, seccomp now works fine on
  non native archs
- cgroup: ignore rootless errors if manager != systemd
- error: always write errors to stderr
- chroot: follow symlinks for the last component
- set $HOME if it is not already defined

* crun-0.9.1

- fix an issue with tmpcopyup that didn't work correctly with symlinks
- create a new cgroup namespace before mounting the cgroup file
  system, so that it uses the correct namespace

* crun-0.9

- fix exec into containers running systemd on cgroups v2
- kill: honor --all
- kill: when not using a PID namespace, use the freezer controller to
  prevent the container forking new processes
- linux: handle tmpcopyup option to copy files from the rootfs to the
  new mounted tmpfs.
- OCI: honor seccomp options.  If not specified any seccomp option,
  now crun will default to using SECCOMP_FILTER_FLAG_SPEC_ALLOW |
  SECCOMP_FILTER_FLAG_LOG when using the seccomp(2)
  syscall

* crun-0.8

- executable lookup. Now create fails immediately if the specified
  executable doesn't exist
- subreaper enabled only when crun is attached
- fix notify socket when used from create and prevent it hanging
  indefinitely when the container exits
- correctly write cpu controller resources when using cgroups v2
- support for the freezer controller when using cgroups v2
- honor unspecified minor/major number for devices when using cgroups v2
- reintroduce --no-pivot
- do not add a cgroup path again if it was already specified in the
  OCI configuration

* crun-0.7

- support devices on cgroups v2 using eBPF.
- new option --cgroup-manager=MANAGER. Accepted values are cgroupfs,
  systemd and disabled.
- can run without using cgroups also as root.
- NOTIFY_SOCKET works also for containers created via create/start.
- when using systemd, create the same name for the scope as runc does.

* crun-0.6

- tty: set the size on the exec tty.
- cgroup: enable only the controllers needed.
- cgroup: in unified mode report the errors also for rootless.
- cgroup2: add support for the cpuset controller.
- linux: ignore tmpcopyup.

* crun-0.5

- logging: support --log=syslog: and log=journald.
- seccomp: if the syscall is not known, ignore it.
- container: move set oom before entering userns.
- status: always honor XDG_RUNTIME_DIR.
- linux: resolve symlinks in the target for bind mounts.
- fix all issues found by Coverity.
- pass Kubernetes e2e tests on Fedora with CRI-O.

* crun-0.4

- partial support for cgroup v2 (cpu, io, memory, pids controllers).
- pass all the OCI validation tests (https://github.com/opencontainers/runtime-tools).
- implement --log-format. crun now works with containerd.
- fixed some issues that prevented crun to work on older kernels.
